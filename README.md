# Labs Zombies: A Cooperative Survival Game in a ZRP World

This repository contains the **first Unity project** developed by me during the ZRP Training Program, a 2-hour-per-week initiative designed to foster skills and teamwork in game development. The project was a collaborative effort, with contributions from colleagues who worked on documentation and some 3D models.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Labs Zombies** is a 4-player cooperative survival game where the objective is to withstand hordes of zombies in a fast-paced and collaborative environment. Drawing inspiration from ZRP's identity, the game focuses on teamwork and quick decision-making.

### 🧩 Core Features
- **Cooperation:** Players must work together to overcome challenges, with game mechanics designed to encourage teamwork.
- **ZRP-Themed Content:** The game's design—including visuals, characters, and maps—integrates ZRP's unique identity.
- **Horde Survival Gameplay:**
  - 10 progressively difficult waves of zombies.
  - Players start with basic equipment and upgrade their gear during intermission phases.
  - The final wave introduces a challenging boss for an ultimate cooperative showdown.

### 📜 Gameplay Loop
1. **Setup:** The game initializes with up to 4 players (bots fill any remaining slots).
2. **Survive Hordes:** Players face waves of zombies, with increasing difficulty and special zombie types.
3. **Intermissions:** After each wave, players can visit shops to purchase new equipment using in-game currency.
4. **Victory:** Defeat the boss in the final wave to win the game.
